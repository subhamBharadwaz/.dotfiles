# Dotfiles for life

This is the configuration I use for my development laptop (WSL included). It’s a combination of borrowed config, settings, and miscellaneous setup stuff that I use all the time.

## What’s in here?

- Shortcut aliases to do things that I otherwise have to Google constantly
- Starship customization
- Oh-My-ZSH customizations
- WSL customizations
- Windows Terminal customizations
- VS Code settings and aliases to use them
